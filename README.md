## Introduction 

`hexo-reference-sci` is based on [hexo-reference-new](https://github.com/kchen0x/hexo-reference) and PR named [modified render logics to support non-number footnote marks](https://github.com/kchen0x/hexo-reference/pull/12). Thanks the original contribution from these two authors. However, when I generate the cross-reference with pached [hexo-reference-new](https://github.com/kchen0x/hexo-reference), some strange behavior appears. This is the first reason I decided to improve the original `hexo-reference-new`.

Furthermore, given that scientific writing has specific requirements regarding citation formatting and other aspects compared to general writing, this plugin will undergo significant modifications based on the existing one.

**Aims**: Generate cross-reference when wring scitific paper or blog.
